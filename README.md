# HBO-COPY_FRONTEND
This is the frontend part of the HBO Max copy I made.

- This was a personal project I made in order to practice redux/toolkit and RTQ Query, using 2 different API'S, 
one created by myself and TMDB API to get data from movies and shows.


Here is the link for the backend of this project: https://github.com/Stephane-Gon/HBO-COPY_SERVER
